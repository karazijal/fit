Code for FIT tool of library fault injection project, part of Part II Computer Science Tripos Personal Project.

Email for copy of the dissertation. Note this is a public port of the original project.


Requirements:
   - yaml
   - jinja2

I'd recommend Linux, as Darwin works (sort of), but not tested to the same level.

1. Run FITgen.py to generate a library. (use -h for some (convenience) options).
2. Look at the config file, especially that directories for log files exist.
3. Run FIT, use +h for options (not "-" for differentiatiion).
